        <h2>What is a drone?</h2>
        <p>Drones, technically referred to as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (or UAVs), are aircrafts without humans aboard. They were originally used primarily in the military, however, they have more recently been used for other commercial and personal purposes, such as new aerial shipping systems including Amazon Prime Air and Google's Project Wing.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Despite all the advantages drones present, some citizens are skeptical of this new technology. Specific compliants include that drones, with their common camera capabilities, may be used to violate personal privacies; and that they may be used as dangerous weapons.</p>
        <p>There are also legal restrictions on the use of drones, specifically in the Washington DC area. Flying drones above 200 feet within 15mi of Washington DC is against the law, as well as flying any drones inside of DC itself.</p>
